## Specs
_As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store)._

_As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list._

_As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake_

_As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg._

_As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1_

_As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them_

_As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Based on price_

_As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers_
